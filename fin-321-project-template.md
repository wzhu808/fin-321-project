## Project Title  
Hawaii Tourism Revenue Forecast & Policy Recommendations

## Team Members  
- William Zhu  
- [Add other names if applicable]

## Objective  
Analyze historical and current tourism revenue trends in Hawaii to forecast future performance and provide actionable policy recommendations to enhance economic stability and sustainable growth.

## Background & Rationale  
Tourism is a major driver of Hawaii’s economy, accounting for a significant portion of state GDP and tax revenues. However, factors such as global economic fluctuations, exchange rate volatility, climate-related disruptions, and changing traveler preferences can impact revenue streams.  
This project seeks to understand these dynamics using historical data, predictive analytics, and policy evaluation to help guide decision-makers in the public and private sectors.
